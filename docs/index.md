# Blakeney Language

## Introduction

Blakeney is a compiled multi-paradigm programming language. Blakeney most closely supports object oriented, structural, procedural and functional programming paradigms.

Blakeney's features are designed to be quick to learn, and great for use in:

 - data science
 - machine learning
 - high throughput and distributed applications
 - extensible compilation targets

There are currently _no_ complete implementations of Blakeney.

## Getting Started

The best place to get started is the [Blakeney By Example](by-example/hello-world.md) guide which introduces the core language features.
